    Step 3: Authenticate Using HTTPS
    When you push or pull from the repository for the first time after switching to HTTPS, Git will prompt you for your GitHub credentials:
    
    GitHub Username: Enter your GitHub username.
    Personal Access Token (PAT): Instead of your password, enter a Personal Access Token. If you don't have one, you can create it by following these steps:
    Go to your GitHub settings.
    Click on Generate new token.
    Select the scopes (permissions) you need, usually including repo.
    Generate the token and copy it (you wonâ€™t be able to see it again).
    Step 4: Push Your Changes
